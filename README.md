This Repo is a collection of projects and pages that I have been working on from The Academy Florida's Intro course to HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Python. Each folder within the Web Projects folder will be each individual project/assignment as taught and assigned throughout the course.

For transparency, this Repo is not meant to be part of my "portfolio" - this is a collecton of assignments/lab work as it is being taught in the course, currently running from April '24 - May '24.
